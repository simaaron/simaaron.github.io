My name is Aaron Sim. I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Theoretical Systems Biology Laboratory at Imperial College London, UK. My background is in theoretical high energy physics where I worked on generalised geometries in string theory. My current research involves the development of machine learning tools and statistical models for the analysis of biological and other complex systems. On this blog I will write about topics related to my research.
